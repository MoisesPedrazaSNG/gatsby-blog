I'm creating this cheat sheet in order to have one place to look at wheen i need to create a new project, i dont know about you guys but since i only do it once and then i start working for quite a bit on that project, i always forgot how to create a new project when i want to create it again.

I used to have that written in my notes, but makes more sense to have it here so hope you like it.

## Angular

```
ng new name-of-your-project
```

## React

```
npx create-react-app my-app 
```
